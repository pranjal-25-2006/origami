<h3>MORE ABOUT THESE ANIMALS!!</h3>
<h5>CAMELS</h5>
<p>A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive </p><p>fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. ... The one-humped dromedary </p><p>makes up 94% of the world's
     camel population, and the two-humped<p> Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.</p>
<hr></hr>


<h5>CHAMELEON</h5>
<p>Chameleons are reptiles that are part of the iguana suborder. </p><p>These colorful lizards are known as one of the few animals that can change </p><p>skin color. 
    However, it is a misconception<p> that chameleons change colors to match their surroundings.</p>
<hr></hr>


<h5>PIGEON</h5>
<p>Despite this, city pigeons today are seen as pests,<p> mainly due to their droppings. </p>
<p>Feral pigeons are considered invasive in many parts of the world,<p> though they have a low impact on wild bird populations and environment.</p>
<hr></hr>


<h5>TEDDY BEAR</h5>
<p>A teddy bear is a stuffed toy in the form of a bear. ... </p><p>Teddy bears are among the most popular gifts for children </p><p>and are often given to adults to signify love, affection, congratulations,</p> or sympathy</p>
<hr></hr>

<h5>PANDA</h5>
<p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China,</p><p> where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. </p><p>They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending</p><p> on what part of the bamboo they are eating.</p><p> They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
<hr></hr>

<h5>CICADA</h5>
<p>Cicadas are also known for their buzzing and clicking noises, </p><p>which can be amplified by multitudes of insects into an overpowering hum.</p><p> Males produce this species-specific noise with vibrating membranes on their abdomens.</p><p> The sounds vary widely, and some species are more musical than others.</p>
